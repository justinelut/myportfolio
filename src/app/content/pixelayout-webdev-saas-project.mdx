## Additional Features

## Additional Features

### Google Authentication
I implemented Google Authentication to provide users with a secure and seamless login experience. By integrating Google Authentication, users can conveniently access the platform using their Google accounts, enhancing both security and user experience.

## Achievements

- ## Improved search engine optimization (SEO) & Performance

  Utilizing Next.js server components and prerendering some static pages like the home page, we achieved incredible performance. This reduced page load times and improved SEO, as seen in the Google Lighthouse results below:

  ![Google Lighthouse Results](https://api2.pixelayout.site/api/files/bs6ha7egdp060nv/m64qkhffnnx65gx/screenshot_2024_05_30_182857_x2MTXUdte6.webp?token=)

  This optimization led to better indexing on Google and enhanced performance.

- ## Increased user conversions
  Users visiting Pixelayout SaaS increased, leading to higher conversion rates compared to the previous platform. This can be attributed to several Next.js features:
  
    1. Better initial load layout-shift management.
    2. Smooth transition between pages.
    3. No page reloads between pages, reducing server load from pages fetching data from Pocketbase.

These features collectively contributed to a more seamless user experience and higher conversion rates.
